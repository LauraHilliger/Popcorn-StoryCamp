                <h2>Week One: Introduction</h2>
              </div>
              <div class="modal-body">
                <p>In the first week, the project is introduced to the learners either in person or as a synchronous, virtual video conference.
                  Choose a specific theme or topic that you want your learners to explore and modify the project outline below
                  to fit your topic (Italicized text in the project outline indicates the example theme).</p>
                <p> Watch the entire Intro to Web Native Film video to give a brief introduction to the six phases this curriculum details.
                  You’ll watch segments again at the beginning of each week to help learners make cognitive connections between
                  the overarching theme of each phase and the work they are doing in assignments.</p>
                <p> Then, separate learners into groups. Keep the groups under five people per group to ensure maximal participation.
                  Try to put learners together that have similar interests, but varying competencies in digital media and the subject
                  you’re basing the project around. Give your learners some tips on how to work together. Talk to them about respecting
                  each others opinions, division of labor, Netiquette, turn-taking, etc.</p>
                <p> Next introduce the project and answer any questions your learners might have about your requirements. Think of
                  innovative ways you can use peer assessment to inspire learners to maintain a good work ethic, and explain these
                  assessment procedures to your learners. A sample peer assessment worksheet has been included in the appendix.</p>
                <p> You might want to give some quick crash courses on setup and basic usage of the collaborative tools. It’s also recommended
                  that you talk a little about the intensity of this project. Groups will likely need time outside of the classroom
                  to complete the project. However, creating a Web Native Film and a supporting site can be very easy or very
                  dedicated, it’s completely up to you.</p>
                <h3>Project Outline</h3>
                <p> You and your group will collaborate to create a Web Native Film and a supporting Tumblr site.
                  The Web Native Film should critically and creatively explore a theme related to Organic Farming.
                  The supporting site should:
                <ul>
                  <li> showcase the film and the process through which the film was created </li>
                  <li>introduce each member of your group </li>
                  <li>introduce the sub-theme of Organic Farming. Example: „Supporting the New Generation of Organic Farmers“ </li>
                  <li>present, support and justify the project narrative explored in the film </li>
                  <li>give detailed information on each members perception of this theme AND regular updates (weekly) on the
                    creation process through blog posts that use examples, videos, demos and remixes. </li>
                  <li>highlight underlying concepts that connect these perceptions </li>
                  <li>allow easy social sharing and commenting </li>
                  <li>use video, text, graphics, photographs, animations and other forms of media that are self made or have a
                    Creative Commons license and properly attributes all sources.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p> A note about group dynamics: After the introduction phase, give your learners some time to get to know each
                  other. Trust is an important issue in group work, so the first set of assignments are designed to circumnavigate
                  typical problems and get group members cooperating despite the difficulties that come with working collaboratively
                  through communication technology.</p>
                <h3>Assignments</h3>
                <h4>1: Individual Blogpost</h4>
                <p> <strong>Tool:</strong> Your personal website, Tumblr, Wordpress, Blogger, etc. Write a blog post on the week one guest speaker and initial thoughts on the project.</p>
                <h4>2: Make a Procedural Story with the Mad Libs Template</h4>
                <p> <strong>Tool:</strong> Popcorn Maker</p>
                <h4>3: Ice Breaker Activity</h4>
                <p> <strong>Tool:</strong> Big Blue Button, Google Hangouts, Voxli, Skype, etc</p>
                <p> Just hang out with your group and have a social hour over video chat. Try Google Hangouts or use Skype Conferencing.
                  Or meet up in person for an hour. We’ll do an informal report-back on your social hour next week (ie I’ll ask you
                  if it was fun :)</p>

                <h4>Evidence of Data Gathering</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li> Did my peer show that he/she had gathered assets to support his/her opinions and his/her web native story? </li>
                  <li>Did my peer properly attribute resources?</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Evidence of Understanding</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Did my peer show that he/she understood the information gleaned from the video/reading/group activity/etc? </li>
                  <li>Have they used their own words to restate or paraphrase the material? </li>
                  <li>Can they explain the key issues in their own words?</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Evidence of Reflection and Analysis</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Does my peers work show effective iteration? </li>
                  <li>Does my peers work show that they have drawn a conclusion about the topic?</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Evidence of Creativity</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Did my peer create anything that shows a new take on the topic and his/her own grasp of the topic?</li>

              <div class="modal-body">
                <p>Lead a guided discussion and critical thought experiment surrounding the history of media and how specific medias
                  altered our cultural landscape, why this happened, why it was/is important. Have learners take notes on the discussion.
                  Some stuff you can talk about with your learners:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li> <strong>The Printing Press</strong> – Before Gutenberg invented the printing press, communicating with the masses was
                    something that only the Church or the very wealthy could do. Information was localized and it stayed localized, it
                    wasn’t copied or distributed often and there was a massive divide between the haves and have nots. Then, Martin
                    Luther used the technology to start the Protestant Reformation....</li>
                  <li> Thomas Edison invented <strong>the Phonograph</strong>, instigating Mass Medium #2: Recordings. Edison’s invention allowed
                    people to share information first hand, over time and across great distances. Recorded music influenced society
                    in a great many ways. Jazz, for example, opened the doors for newly freed slaves to become entertainers and in
                    the 60’s Rock and Roll continued the “freeing” of people of color as well as women from traditional life styles. </li>
                  <li><strong>Cinema</strong> expanded on recordings allowing us to both SEE and hear other people’s experiences. For more detailed
                    discussion points on cinema, see A Brief History of Storytelling</li>
                  <li> <strong>Radio</strong> – When Marconi figured out how to transmit live messages using Morse code, he changed the way mankind
                    related to information. It was the first time we could experience what was going on “over there” instantaneously.
                    The reason that the Titanic sinking had such an impact is partly because live transmits were being sent from the
                    scene. People were able to experience the drama as it happened and it’s been said that the only reason there were
                    ANY survivors from the Titanic was because of Marconi’s invention.</li>
                  <li> Then came <strong>Television</strong>, initially an extension of radio broadcasts, early TV was probably kind of boring. But now,
                    we all know that TV has the power to inform us instantaneously. And to show us that in “reality” everyone has perfect
                    hair and teeth.</li>
                  <li> After TV nothing happened for a while until the US Military started experimenting with distributed computer networks.
                    That didn’t actually help out the general public much until 1989 when Tim Berner’s Lee developed <strong>the
                    World Wide Web</strong>. Now the WWW can do everything the first 5 media forms could do:
                  <li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Read and publish content </li>
                      <li>play recordings </li>
                      <li>watch movies </li>
                      <li>listen to radio </li>
                      <li>watch TV</li>
                    </ul>
                    There is a lot of crap on the Internet, true, but there is also a lot of truly fascinating and thought provoking information
                    that is changing society every day. Just look at the Arab Spring, for example, and the fact that Twitter had an
                    integral part in instigating real-world change in Egypt.</li>

              <h2>A Brief History of Storytelling</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
              <h3> Introduction</h3>
              <p> To understand the tremendous opportunities that the internet offers as a new storytelling medium, we need to first
                begin to think about it as a new “canvas” with its own unique properties, and we need to understand how it is different
                than the artistic forms of expression that have preceded it.</p>
              <p> This handout provides a brief historical review of the evolution visual storytelling. It focuses specifically on how artists
                took advantage of each new technological development in visual expression, but also how each development
                – from painting to photography to motion pictures to video games – also dictated the kind of content that is produced.
                Thinking about each art form this way will be crucial when we envision the internet as a storytelling canvas
                and discuss the best-practices for web-native filmmaking.</p>
              <p> Anyone who has ever tried to write a script knows that you cannot write interior thoughts in a screenplay, you can
                only what we can see and hear. In a novel, you can write “Tom is hungry” – you can tell us that someone is hungry,
                but in a movie you must show us that Tom is hungry: “Tom’s stomach rumbles.” The novel may have the advantage
                over the film in sharing interior thoughts, but can written words express the grandeur of Avatar’s visuals? Or express
                the depths of Heath Ledger’s unsettling performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight?</p>
              <p> Or: Imagine you were given a pad of paper and a pencil and asked to tell a story with it. Now imagine you were
                given the same pad but with a set of watercolor paints instead – don’t you think the kind of story you told, and how
                you told it, would be different? Now imagine your pad of paper is the internet…</p>
              
              <h3>Cave Paintings</h3>
              <p> Thirty four thousand years ago, in a large cave in
                Southern France, an artist used pigment to create some
                of the first known paintings. Herds of bison, charging
                rhinos, leaping gazelle. The animals – some of them now
                extinct - were rendered in startling detail. However, these
                were not simply portraits. The animals were interacting
                with one another – and interaction is story. The artist
                was a storyteller. By using visual means of expression to
                recount the artist’s experiences at that moment in time,
                we can draw a line between the caves of southern France
                and the contemporary stories we see unfolding on our
                computer monitors in the present day.</p>
              <p><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5142/5602930382_cee5f3f43a_m.jpg"/> There is evidence that those early painters struggled
                with the limitations of their chosen “canvas” and also
                found ways to take advantage of the opportunities their
                unique art form provided them. Painters in the Chauvet
                caves sanded down the textured walls to have a lighter,
                smoother surface upon which to work, and then after the
                paintings were completed they etched an outline of the
                subject into the stone so that the torchlight would cast
                shadows that made the image stand out. In other places, rather than try to disguise the texture or curvature of the
                walls, the artists actually incorporated these qualities into their work. A jagged piece of the wall could be used to
                represent fur, the sloping lines of a rock race could direct the viewer’s eye to where the artist wanted them to look.</p>
              <p>So what can we say made the cave wall unique as a medium for visual expression? What are its benefits as a canvas?
                What are its limitations? First off, the work of art is singular – you cannot copy a cave wall. Obviously, this also
                means you must go to the cave – it isn’t coming to you. While this may seem like a limitation, think about the experience
                of standing before something that you know is unique in the world – a building, a sculpture, even a person.
                Something that can be copied is more accessible, but for that very reason it also loses some of its magic. Cave
                walls are rarely smooth, so you must accommodate the textures and shape of the wall, but they are also not confined
                to a specific shape the way a piece of paper or a canvas is. It can take any shape, and it is three-dimensional –
                there is freedom, and possibility, that doesn’t exist in the confines of an 8.5x11 sheet of paper.</p>
              <p> We could spend time discussing the evolution of painting, the advantages and disadvantages of watercolor vs. oilbased
                paint, but you get the point – each medium is unique, each has its strengths and limitations, and our images
                and stories are shaped by the medium we choose to express ourselves in. Moving on!</p>
             
              <h3>Photography</h3>
              <p><img src="img/02_JosephNiepce.jpg"/> The first photographs were taken by a Frenchman named Joseph
                Nicephore Niepce in 1827. They were called Heliographs because the
                images were etched by rays of light from the sun. Later, photography
                would capture an image on a celluloid material – called a negative –
                that allowed for the precise duplication of images.</p>
              <p> Photography was unique in many ways: it produced art that precisely
                replicated the subject, unlike the subjective interpretations of painting
                or drawing. It also was produced quickly – the image was captured in
                a fraction of a second, and the chemical developing and printing could
                be done in hours. Its speed and potential for reproduction made photography
                the most important development in visual expression in centuries.</p>
              <p> If the benefits of photography were its striking ability to produce what we would consider “life-like” imagery at a
                remarkable speed, what were its limitations? As with painting on canvas (and perhaps because of the canvas), a
                rectangular frame was quickly agreed upon by purveyors of the art. Once mass-produced cameras embraced the
                aspect ratio the rectangle became the format that all photos had to adhere to. Images were also limited to black
                and white expression for the first 75 years of photographic history; readily accessible color photography was introduced
                to the public in 1903.</p>
              <p> Perhaps most importantly, though, the photographic artist also surrendered control over the subject – a painter
                could create each aspect of the image as she desired, while a photographer is “stuck” with using what actually exists
                in the world. The photograph sacrificed poetry for authenticity.</p>
              <h3>Motion Pictures & Television</h3>
              <p><img src="img/muybridge.jpg" width="200px"/> The first motion picture device is credited to Eadweard
                Muybridge, who used a series of cameras to study the
                motion of horses in 1877.</p>
              <p> Movie cameras built upon the still-image camera’s capacity
                for capturing what is perceived as reality. The combination
                of photographic fidelity with seamlessly moving
                images, along with the invention of the magnetic audio
                track and the development of a system of editing by early American filmmaking pioneers like Thomas Edison and D.W, Griffith, resulted in an art form that viewers could engage
                on a level of near-hypnosis.</p>
              <p> At first, however, storytelling wasn’t considered the domain of the motion picture camera, Early films were basically
                long-format still photographs – footage of a baby eating, a train arriving at a station, people leaving work after a long
                day at the factory. In the same way that we see the internet as simply an improved version of other media (better
                than mail, better than a yellow pages, better than a Thomas Brothers, etc), we first envisioned the motion picture
                camera as just a better version of the still camera, rather than its own unique means of artistic expression.
                What we would consider the “grammar” of film language – close up shots, reverse shots, continuity editing, special
                effects – began to emerge at the turn of the century and by the 1914 had crystallized into something we would
                recognize in today’s theatres. And this particular voice, this mode of storytelling that disguises editing and creates a
                highly-seductive illusion of continuous time and space, has become the dominant form of visual storytelling on our
                planet.</p>
              <p> If we identify the unique property of the motion picture storytelling as the ability to create a hypnotic, life-like world
                that the viewer gets sucked into, then what are it’s limitations? Well, for much of its history, motion pictures were so
                prohibitively expensive to make that few people got to make them, and those that did were severely limited in what
                they could do and say by the financial constraints put upon them. In short, movies were expensive to make and had
                to make their money back, so they had to follow a very precise, very limiting formula.</p>
              <p> As filmmaking equipment became more affordable and accessible, there were more opportunities for artists to
                pursue non-commercial storytelling. By the time these opportunities emerged in the 1950s and 1960s (most notably
                in the form of smaller 16mm and 8mm film cameras), though, audiences had a long-established expectation of
                what a film should look and sound like. The magic of film’s ability to mimic real-life was also a prison: audiences did
                not tolerate deviations from that style of storytelling. While we were open minded about impressionist and abstract
                painting, we struggled with motion picture expressions that didn’t hold true to the way we saw and heard the world
                around us.</p>
              <p> A conversation about the developments in motion picture technology and storytelling wouldn’t be complete without
                mention of the television revolution. First design in 1926 and implemented in Germany in 1935, the television came
                to American in 1941 and by 1959 there were 50 million TV sets in the country.</p>
              <p> Television offered a revolutionary means of engagement: changing the channel. This wasn’t available when one
                went to the movies – the closest a filmgoer could come to changing the channel was walking out of one theater
                and into another. Television also offered live broadcasts, offering a more comprehensive experience than the radio
                broadcast. Finally, the content was also endlessly streaming: you could always watch television. These qualities are
                both early echoes of the interaction we see with the internet today.</p>
              <p> If film form was limiting in its scope and language, though, television was far more so. Deeply-rooted financial pressures
                and rigorously adhered-to schedules (24 minutes for a half-hour slot, 44 minutes for an hour slot, etc) made
                television highly formulaic and limited in storytelling opportunities.</p>

              <p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Spacewar!-PDP-1-20070512.jpg/320px-Spacewar!-PDP-1-20070512.jpg" width="200px"/> The first video game is widely recognized as “Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Device”, an extremely basic one-player
                proto-Missile Command devised in 1947 for an analog computer. Fifty years later, video games would surpass motion
                pictures as the high-grossing visual-storytelling medium on the planet.</p>
              <p> While television gave you the opportunity to change the channel from one story to another, video games offered the
                opportunity to actually change and even create the content of the story. Most story-based video games still operate on a largely linear path with a set outcome, the gettingthere
                is going to be unique for each “user” (and note the
                distinction between “viewers” and “users” – what do we
                call people who engage with web-native films?) And while
                video games may have lacked the life-like image quality
                of films, they made up for it in interactivity and identification:
                having an avatar – a graphic representation of the
                user – that responded to her commands.</p>
              <p> Interactive storytelling is becoming increasingly common
                in our society. Consoles like the Wii have made gaming
                more accessible to broader communities. The passivity
                of the motion picture experience is being challenged by
                the interactivity of the gaming console. Again, we can see
                echoes of the internet in the degree to which the user or
                viewer can dictate the terms of engagement with the story.</p>

                <p> <strong>Tool:</strong> Your personal website, Tumblr, Wordpress, Blogger, etc. Write a blog post on the week three guest speaker.</p>
                <h4>2: Create a Gender Remix</h4>
                <p> <strong>Tool:</strong> <a href="http://www.genderremixer.com/lego/" target="_blank">the Gender Remixer</a> Play around with the Gender Remixer for a few minutes. Think about what happens to the context of the commercial
                  when the video and audio don’t match.</p>
                <h4>3: Jack the News</h4>
                <p> <strong>Tool:</strong> <a href="http://newsjack.in/" target="_blank">Newsjack</a></p>

                  <a href="#">DIY Contextual</a></p>
                <h4>5: Sketch a Basic Schematic and Make Design Decisions</h4>
                <p>In this project you will create a web native film AND build a fully functioning website. You’ll need to figure out the
                  structures of these two pieces and make decisions about content. Read the Designing for Web to help you create a
                  schematic for the website. Create a storyboard and schematic for your Popcornified video.</p>
                <h4>6: Write your Group Profile</h4>
                <p>Make profiles for each member of the group as well as a group profile. Be creative! A profile doesn’t necessarily
                  have to include text! Maybe you want to use Popcorn to make a profile for yourself?</p>
                <h4>7: Create a Presentation</h4>
                <p>You’ll be giving a presentation about your concept. This should include:</p>

                  <li>a plan for using page elements (what kind of logo, headlines, graphics etc) </li>
                  <li>a plan for your Web Native Film</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Prepare a 10 minute presentation. You can make a slideshow, pdf, video, etc. You can even create an online presentation
                  depending on the skills your group members have.</p>

                <h3>Designing for your AUDIENCE:</h3>
                <p> You need to know who your target audience is. A target audience is a group of people that have something in common,
                  and it greatly influences many design aspects.</p>
                <p> Think about the type of people you want to engage. Make notes about things like age, family status, computer experience
                  and interests or hobbies.</p>
                <h4> Ask yourself:</h4>
                <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>How old are these people? </li>
                  <li>Do they have a lot of family obligations? </li>
                  <li>Do they have a particular career path? </li>
                  <li>How often are they online? </li>
                  <li>What are their hobbies?</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Write a general description of your user.</p>
                <p> The target audience is important because it helps to answer a bunch of design questions you’re going to have.</p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Age range: Could impact color scheme, text size, and language used.</li>
                  <li> Level of computer experience: Impacts viewer’s ability to interact with the site. What are they used to in terms
                    of site design?</li>
                  <li> Hobbies/Interests/Pastimes: May help to gear and guide the taste of the site as well as point views to other
                    resources within these interests that they enjoy.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h3> Content</h3>
                <p> Write all the content bits and pieces out on little pieces of paper. Then, categorize the pieces. This exercise will give
                  you a logical global navigation (and subnavigation if you have lots of content).</p>
                <p> There’s no one way to organize content. You need to have a feel for what your content is, and then categorize
                  pieces together. Don’t forget, it’s easier to rearrange pieces of paper than electronic data.</p>
                <p> This process doesn’t just help the organization of content, it also helps you begin to think about production resources
                  you will need and a time plan.
                <p>
                <h3> Navigation</h3>
                <p> If you’ve worked through the content section, you’ll know that Navigation relies quite heavily on the content. Organizing
                  content will reveal logical global and sub navigation. What comes first? Create a hierarchy for your content.</p>
                <p> The site map shows exactly how many navigational items you’ll need as well as the hierarchy of the pages. The creation
                  of a site map will also help you eliminate irrelevant content and know what you need to produce. It’s a good
                  idea to take your time with this because without it, it will quickly become confusing where a particular piece of content
                  “lives”. A simple and clear navigation structure is important so that your users don’t get confused or frustrated.</p>

              <div class="modal-body">
                <p>It might seem strange that the last chapter of the „Intro to Web Native Film“ video is about planning a web native
                  film. It’s true that the planning always comes first, but this curriculum is meant to serve as an introduction. Now
                  that your learners have all the technical and communicative skills to create a large scale collaborative project, they’ll
                  think about planning differently. Rewatch the last chapter with your learners and lead a discussion about how their
                  ideas have changed based on the last few weeks.</p>
